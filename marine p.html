    <h1 class="head1">Marine Pollution</h1>
    <p class="par">There is ample evidence of the numerous detrimental effects that human activity has on our seas and oceans. Indeed, until recently, it was considered that the water covering a large portion of our world was so enormous that it would absorb any garbage we threw at it, meaning that people polluted without considering the possible consequences.

        Even while people in today's society are far more aware of the risks posed by marine pollution, in many situations the damage has already been done and in many more it still occurs. But not every kind of pollution is the same. The four most prevalent types of marine pollution are broken down below, along with the detrimental consequences they may have on marine life.

                <h3 class="head3">&nbsp&nbsp1. Plastic Pollution </h3></a>
                <p> Approximately eight million tonnes of plastic debris are thought to reach our oceans year, in addition to the 150 million tonnes that are already there. Larger plastic particles have the potential to harm coral reefs and entangle fish and mammals, but they gradually breakdown into many tiny pieces. Because species of all sizes are more prone to confuse these particles—known as microplastics—for food, they have the potential to be far more harmful. They not only load the animal's stomach with non-nutritional plastic debris but can also damage the animal's internal organs and impair its immune system after consume.

                <h3 class="head3">&nbsp&nbsp2. Light Pollution</h3></a>
                <p> There will always be light wherever there are people living. Since many towns and cities are constructed close to the coast, light from the lamps that brighten our streets, residences, workplaces, and other public locations may also find its way beneath the waves. Fish and other marine species' circadian rhythms can be disturbed by the artificial light present at night, which can interfere with their regular activities. While fish living in reefs may have their reproductive cycles thrown off, larger fish can more readily hunt smaller species.

                <h3 class="head3">&nbsp&nbsp3. Noise Pollution</h3></a>
                <p> Although noise pollution is typically associated with construction sites and industrial areas, noises can actually travel farther and for longer underwater than they can in the air. Because of this, marine creatures are far more vulnerable to noise pollution resulting from human activities than they are to terrestrial or aerial pollutants. Animals that rely on sonar signals for feeding, mating, and navigating the ocean may become confused by noise pollution, which can also shorten their lives and endanger the existence of entire species.

                <h3 class="head3">&nbsp&nbsp4. Chemical Pollution</h3></a>
                <p> Farmers frequently utilize pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides to increase yields and guard against illnesses and pests. Regretfully, prolonged downpours have the potential to carry these substances into gutters, streams, and rivers, where they may ultimately find their way into marine habitats. While there are sustainable ways to remove contaminants such as ammonia and phosphate from these kinds of ecosystems, they are not necessarily as widely used or as efficient as we would like. This causes an imbalance in the nutrients in the water, which encourages the growth of algae blooms, robs other species of their necessary space, sunlight, and nutrients, and upsets the ecosystems' natural balance.

                <h3 class="head3">&nbsp&nbsp5. Oil Spills</h3></a>
                <p> When tankers are transporting crude oil at sea, accidents might happen. The influence they have on the marine ecosystem and the difficulty of cleaning them up, however, make them exceedingly harmful. 
                    Oxygen cannot dissolve in the water due to a thin layer of oil that accumulates on the surface. It can harm seabirds and contaminate beaches in coastal areas. A bird dies of hypothermia when its wings are coated in oil, rendering it unable to fly and losing the ability to insulate its feathers.
