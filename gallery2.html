Carbonate ions are necessary for the growth and survival of shells on clams, mussels, crabs, corals, and other marine organisms.Ocean surface temperatures are rising due to the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is also contributing to ocean acidification.Despite being two distinct phenomena, warming and acidity combine to harm marine ecosystems.
